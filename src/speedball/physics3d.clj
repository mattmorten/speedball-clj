(comment
  "I tried to do something clever with 3D kinematics, but I don't think it really worked out. Next step instead is to rework this, just using 2D positions. We can model the Z axis separately later. Model a constant speed while in the air. We know the ball is in the air for X seconds depending on how fast you've thrown it. Once it hits the ground you can decay the speed.")
